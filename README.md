<h2>How It's Made:</h2>
<p>Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TheCocktailDBApi</p>

<p>Random cocktail generator that displays information retrieved from API.<br>
  Includes: Drink Name, Image, Ingredients, Measurements, and Instructions</p>

<h2>Optimizations:</h2>
<p>This project gives the user the capability to refresh and it will display a new random drink each time.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
<p>Concatenation was more detailed than I initially thought when I tried to put a header on the Ingredients.<br>
API properties are very important. Also had to use conditional to get rid of null values.</p>
